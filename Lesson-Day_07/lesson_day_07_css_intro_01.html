    <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    <p>
      The <span><i>cottage garden</i></span> is a distinct style of garden that uses an
      informal design, dense plantings and a mixture of ornamental and edible
      plants.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Cottage Garden originated in <span>England</span> and its history can be 
        traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, 
        when stylized versions were created as a reaction to the more structured and 
        rigorously maintained <span>English estate gardens</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants,
        with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.
